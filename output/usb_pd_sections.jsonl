{"doc_title":"USB Power Delivery Specification Rev 3.2","section_id":"1","title":"Introduction","page":34,"level":1,"full_path":"1 Introduction","tags":[],"content":"USB has evolved from a data interface capable of supplying limited power to a primary provider of power with a data interface. Today many devices charge or get their power from USB Ports contained in laptops, cars, aircraft or even wall sockets. USB has become a ubiquitous power socket for many small devices such as cell phones and other hand-held devices. Users need USB to fulfill their requirements not only in terms of data but also to provide power to, or charge, their devices simply, often without the need to load a driver, in order to carry out “traditional” USB functions. There are, however, still many devices which either require an additional power connection to the wall, or exceed the USB default current in order to operate. Increasingly, international regulations require better energy management due to ecological and practical concerns relating to the availability of power. Regulations limit the amount of power available from the wall which has led to a pressing need to optimize power usage. The USB Power Delivery Specification has the potential to minimize waste as it becomes a standard for charging devices that are not satisfied by [USBBC 1.2] or [USB Type-C 2.4]. Wider usage of wireless solutions is an attempt to remove data cabling but the need for “tethered” charging remains. In addition, industrial design requirements drive wired connectivity to do much more over the same connector. USB Power Delivery is designed to enable the maximum functionality of USB by providing more flexible power delivery along with data over a single cable. Its aim is to operate with and build on the existing USB ecosystem; increasing power levels from existing USB standards, for example [USBBC 1.2], enabling new higher power use cases such as USB powered Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), laptops and monitors. With USB Power Delivery the power direction is no longer fixed. This enables the product with the power (USB Host or Peripheral) to provide the power. For example, a display with a supply from the wall can power, or charge, a laptop. Alternatively, USB Chargers are able to supply power to laptops and other Battery powered devices through their, traditional power providing, USB Ports. USB Power Delivery enables Hubs (including Hubs embedded in other devices such as docks or monitors) to become the means to optimize power management across multiple peripherals by allowing each device to take only the power it requires, and to get more power when required for a given application. Optionally the Hubs can communicate with the PC to enable even more intelligent and flexible management of power either automatically or with some level of user intervention. USB Power Delivery allows low power cases such as headsets to Negotiate for only the power they require. This provides a simple solution that enables USB devices to operate at their optimal power levels. The Power Delivery Specification, in addition to providing mechanisms to Negotiate power also can be used as a side-band channel for standard and vendor defined messaging. The specification enables discovery of cable Capabilities such as supported speeds and current levels. Power Delivery enables alternative modes of operation by providing the mechanisms to discover, enter and exit Modes such as EPR Mode, USB4® Mode or Alternate Modes."}
{"doc_title":"USB Power Delivery Specification Rev 3.2","section_id":"1.1","title":"Overview","page":34,"level":2,"parent_id":"1","full_path":"1.1 Overview","tags":[],"content":"This specification defines how USB Devices can Negotiate for more current and/or higher or lower voltages over the USB cable (using the USB Type-C® CC wire as the communications channel) than are defined in the [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB4], [USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2] specifications. It allows Devices with greater power requirements than can be met with today's specification to get the power they require to operate from VBUS and Negotiate with external power sources (e.g., Chargers). In addition, it allows a Source and Sink to swap Power Roles such that a USB Device could supply power to the USB Host. For example, a display could supply power to a laptop to operate or charge its Battery. This specification also adds a mechanism to swap the Data Roles such that the upstream facing Port becomes the downstream facing Port and vice versa. It also enables a swap of the end supplying VCONN to a powered cable. The USB Power Delivery Specification is guided by the following principles:  Works seamlessly with legacy USB Devices.  Compatible with existing spec-compliant USB cables.  Minimizes potential damage from non-compliant cables (e.g., ‘Y’ cables etc.).  Optimized for low-cost implementations. This specification defines mechanisms to discover, enter and exit Alternate Modes defined either by a standard or by a particular vendor. These Alternate Modes can be supported either by the Port Partner or by a cable connecting the two Port Partners. The specification defines mechanisms to discover the Capabilities of cables which can communicate using Power Delivery. To facilitate optimum charging, the specification defines two mechanisms a USB Charger can Advertise for the device to use: 1) A list of Fixed Supply voltages each with a maximum current. The device selects a voltage and current from the list. This is the traditional model used by devices that use internal electronics to manage the charging of their Battery including modifying the voltage and current actually supplied to the Battery. The side-effect of this model is that the charging circuitry generates heat that can be problematic for small form factor devices. 2) A list of programmable voltage ranges, in SPR PPS Mode, each with a maximum current. The device re quests a voltage (in 20mV increments) that is within the Advertised range and a maximum current. The USB PPS Charger delivers the requested voltage until the maximum current is reached at which time the USB PPS Charger reduces its output voltage so as not to supply more than the requested maximum current. During the high current portion of the charge cycle, the USB PPS Charger can be directly con nected (through an appropriate safety device) to the Battery. This model is used by devices that want to minimize the thermal impact of their internal charging circuitry. 3) A list of adjustable voltage ranges, in SPR AVS Mode or EPR AVS Mode, each with a maximum current. The device requests a voltage (in 100mV increments) that is within the Advertised range and a maxi mum current. The USB AVS Charger delivers the requested voltage."}

This specification is intended to be fully compatible with and extend the existing USB infrastructure. It is intended that this specification will allow system OEMs, power supply and Peripheral developers adequate flexibility for product versatility and market differentiation without losing backwards compatibility. USB Power Delivery is designed to operate independently of the existing USB bus defined mechanisms used to Negotiate power which are:  [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2] in band requests for high power interfaces.  [USBBC 1.2] mechanisms for supplying higher power (not mandated by this specification).  [USB Type-C 2.4] mechanisms for supplying higher power. Initial operating conditions remain the USB Default Operation as defined in [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2].  The DFP sources vSafe5V over VBUS.  The UFP consumes power from VBUS."}

USB Safe State State of the USB Type-C connector when there are pins to be re-purposed (see [USB Type-C 2.4]) so they are not damaged by and do not cause damage to their Port Partner. USB Type-A Term used to refer to any A plug or receptacle including USB Micro-A plugs and USB Standard A plugs and receptacles. USB Micro-AB receptacles are assumed to be a combination of USB Type-A and USB Type-B. USB Type-B Terms used to refer to any B-plug or receptacle including USB Micro-B plugs and USB Standard B plugs and receptacles, including the PD and non-PD versions. USB Micro-AB receptacles are assumed to be a combination of USB Type-A and USB Type-B. USB Type-C Term used to refer to the USB Type-C connector plug, or receptacle as defined in [USB Type-C 2.4]. USB Type-C Multi-Port A product that exposes multiple USB Type-C Source Ports for the purpose of charging multiple Charger connected USB Devices as defined in [USB Type-C 2.4]. USB-C® Port Control Module in a PD Capable device which controls Attach/Detach and either detects or sets the Rp value. USB-IF PD SID Standard ID allocated to this specification by the USB Implementer’s Forum. USB4® Mode Device is operating in a Mode as defined in [USB4]. UUT See Unit Under Test. Variable Supply A poorly regulated power supply that is not a Battery. This is exposed by the Variable Supply PDO (see Section 6.4.2, \"Request Message\"). VBUS The VBUS wire delivers power from a Source to a Sink. VCONN Once the connection between USB Host and device is established, the CC pin (CC1 or CC2) in the receptacle that is not connected via the CC wire through the standard cable is re-purposed to source VCONN to power circuits in a Cable Plug, VCONN Powered Accessory or VCONN Powered USB Device (see [USB Type-C 2.4]). VCONN Powered Accessory An accessory that is powered from VCONN to operate in an Alternate Mode (see [USB Type-C 2.4]). VCONN Powered USB Charge A CT-VPD is a VPD with an additional port for connecting a Source (e.g., a Charger) as defined in Through Device [USB Type-C 2.4]. When no Charger is connected, a CT-VPD behaves as a VPD. When a Charger is connected, no PD communication to the CT-VPD itself is possible as CC is connected to the Charger port. Hence all PD communication then is with the Charger and the cable with which it is connected. Term Description VCONN Powered USB Device A captive cable USB Device that can be powered by either VCONN or VBUS as defined in [USB Type C 2.4]. A VPD is a captive cable USB Device that can be powered by either VCONN or VBUS and only responds to SOP’ Communication as defined in the Tables in Section 6.12, \"State behavior\"). It only responds to Messages sent with a Specification Revision of at least Revision 3.x. A VPD is not allowed to support Alternate Modes. The term VPD refers to either a VPD or a CT-VPD with no Charger connected. VCONN Source The USB Type-C Port responsible for sourcing VCONN. VCONN Swap Process of exchanging the VCONN Source between Port Partners. VDEM See Vendor Defined Extended Message. VDM See Vendor Defined Message. VDM Header The first Data Object following the Message Header in a Vendor Defined Message. The VDM Header contains the SVID relating to the VDM being sent and provides information relating to the Command in the case of a Structured VDM (see Section 6.4.4, \"Vendor Defined Message\"). VDO See Vendor Data Object. Vendor Data Object Data Object used to send Vendor specific information as part of a Message. Vendor Defined Extended PD Extended Message defined for vendor/standards usage. A VDEM does not define any Message structure and Messages can be created in any manner that the vendor chooses. Vendor Defined Message PD Data Message defined for vendor/standards usage. These are further partitioned into Structured Vendor Defined Messages, where Commands are defined in this specification, and Unstructured Vendor Defined Messages which are entirely vendor defined (see Section 6.4.4, \"Vendor Defined Message\"). Vendor ID 16-bit unsigned value assigned by the USB-IF to a given Vendor. Version A minor release of the USB Power Delivery specification associated with a particular Revision.

The PD mechanisms operate independently of and supersede other USB methods defined in [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USBBC 1.2] and [USB Type-C 2.4]. USB Power Delivery also defines sideband mechanisms used for configuration management of USB Type-C devices and cables. Using Structured Vendor Defined Messages (Structured VDMs), PD facilitates discovery of device and cables features and performance. Structured VDMs are also used to enter/exit some Active Modes, either USB-based (e.g., USB4® Mode) or USB Type-C Alternate Modes. Alternate Modes are associated with Standard or Vendor IDs (SVIDs) and can be either standard (e.g., DisplayPort Alternate Mode) or proprietary (e.g., Intel Thunderbolt™ 3)."}

While operating in Power Delivery Mode there will be a Contract in place (either Explicit Contract or Implicit Contract) that determines the power level available and the direction of that power. The Port Pair will remain in Power Delivery Mode until the Port Pair is Detached, there is a Hard Reset, or USB Type-C Error Recovery, or the Source removes power except as part of the Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap processes. Note: [USB4] does not define a default power, rather relies on a PD power Contract. When first Attached the [USB4] device operates in [USB 3.2] Mode which is its USB Default Operation. An Explicit Contract is Negotiated by the process of the Source sending a set of Capabilities, from which the Sink is required to request a particular capability and then the Source accepting this request. An Implicit Contract is the specified level of power allowed in particular states (i.e., during and after a Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap). Implicit Contracts are temporary; Port Pairs are required to immediately Negotiate an Explicit Contract. Each Provider has a Local Policy, governing power allocation to its Ports. Consumers also have their own Local Policy governing how they draw power. A System Policy can be enacted over USB that allows modification to this Local Policy and hence management of overall power allocation in the system. When PD Capable devices are Attached to each other, the DFPs and UFPs initially default to standard USB Default Operation. The DFP supplies vSafe5V and the UFP draws current in accordance with the rules defined by [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2] specifications. After Power Delivery Negotiation has taken place, power can be supplied at higher, or lower, voltages and higher currents than defined in these specifications. It is also possible to:  Do a Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap to exchange the Power Roles such that the DFP receives power and the UFP supplies power.  Do a Data Role Swap such that the DFP becomes the UFP and vice-versa.  Do a VCONN Swap to change the Port supplying VCONN to the cable.  Enter into EPR Mode.  Enter into USB4® Mode.  Enter into Alternate Modes.  Send Vendor Defined Messages. Prior to the First Explicit Contract only the Source Port, which is also the VCONN Source, can communicate with the Attached cable assembly. This is important where 5A and EPR capability are marked as well as other details of the cable assembly such as the supported speed. Cable Discovery, determining whether the cable can communicate, can occur on initial Attachment of a Port Pair before an Explicit Contract has been established. It is also possible to carry out Cable Discovery after a Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap prior to re-establishing an Explicit Contract, where the UFP is the Source, and an Implicit Contract is in place. Cable Discovery can be carried out after an Explicit Contract has been established, if the cable has not yet been discovered."}

SOP’’ Communication can also be supported when SOP’ Communication is also supported. SOP’ and SOP’’ assignment in the cable assembly is fixed and does not change dynamically. SOP Communication between the Port Partners is not recognized by the Cable Plug. Figure 2.2, \"Example SOP' Communication between VCONN Source and Cable Plug(s)\" outlines the usage of SOP* Communications between a VCONN Source (DFP/UFP) and the Cable Plugs. Since all SOP* Communications take place over a single wire (CC), the SOP* Communication periods must be coordinated to prevent important communication from being blocked. For a product which does not recognize SOP/SOP’ or SOP’’ Packets, this will look like a non-Idle channel, leading to missed Packets and retries. Communications between the Port Partners take precedence meaning that communications with the Cable Plug can be interrupted but will not lead to a Soft Reset or Hard Reset. When a Default Contract or Implicit Contract is in place (e.g., at startup, after a Power Role Swap or Fast Role Swap) only the Source Port that is supplying VCONN is allowed to send Packets to a Cable Plug (SOP’) and is allowed to respond to Packets from the Cable Plug (SOP’) with a GoodCRC Message in order to discover the Cable Plug's characteristics (see Figure 2.2, \"Example SOP' Communication between VCONN Source and Cable Plug(s)\"). During this phase, all communication with the Cable Plug is initiated and controlled by the VCONN Source which acts to prevent conflicts between SOP Packets and SOP’ Packets. The Sink does not communicate with the Cable Plug and Discards any SOP’ Packets received. When an Explicit Contract is in place, only the VCONN Source (either the DFP or the UFP) can communicate with the Cable Plug(s) using SOP’ Packets/SOP’’ Packets (see Figure 2.2, \"Example SOP' Communication between VCONN Source and Cable Plug(s)\"). During this phase, all communication with the Cable Plug is initiated and controlled by the VCONN Source which acts to prevent conflicts between SOP* Packets.

There is only one Source Port and one Sink Port in each PD Connection between the Port Partners. At Attach the Source Port (the Port with Rp asserted see [USB Type-C 2.4]) is also the DFP and VCONN Source. At Attach the Sink Port (the Port with Rd asserted) is also the UFP and is not the VCONN Source. The original USB PD specification allowed Sources to deliver up to 100W. This classic Mode of operation is referred to as the Standard Power Range (SPR). The First Explicit Contract, the first Contract after a Default Contract or Implicit Contract, is always an SPR Contract. There is an Optional higher power Mode referred to as the Extended Power Range (EPR) where the Source is allowed to deliver up to 240W. The EPR Mode can only be entered from the SPR Mode. The entry process is designed to prevent accidental entry into this higher power Mode. It can be entered only when an SPR Explicit Contract is in place and both the Source Port and Sink Port as well as the cable support EPR. The Source/Sink Power Roles, DFP/UFP Data Roles and VCONN Source role can all subsequently be swapped orthogonally to each other. A Port that supports both Source and Sink Power Roles is called a Dual-Role Power Port (DRP). A Port that supports both DFP and UFP Data Roles is called a Dual-Role Data Port (DRD). When USB Communications capability is supported in the DFP Data Role then the Port will also be able to act as a USB Host. Similarly, when USB Communications capability is supported in the UFP Data Role then the Port will also be able to act as a USB Device. The following sections describe the high-level operation of ports taking on the roles of DFP, UFP, Source and Sink.

In practice various implementation options are possible based on many different possible types of PD devices. PD devices can have many different configurations e.g., USB Communication or non-USB Communication, single versus multiple Ports, dedicated power supplies versus supplies shared on multiple ports, hardware versus software-based implementations etc. The architecture outlined in this section is therefore provided only for reference to indicate the high-level logical model used by the PD specification. This architecture is used to identify the key concepts and to indicate logical blocks and possible links between them. The USB Power Delivery is a Port to Port architecture in which each PD Capable device is made up of several major components.  Figure 2.3, \"USB Power Delivery Communications Stack\" illustrates the relationship of the layers of the communications stack between a Port Pair. The communications stack consists of:  A Device Policy Manager (see Section 8.2, \"Device Policy Manager\") that exists in all devices and manages USB Power Delivery resources within the device across one or more Ports based on the device's Local Policy.  A Policy Engine (see Section 8.3, \"Policy Engine\") that exists in each USB Power Delivery Port implements the Local Policy for that Port.  A Protocol Layer (see Section 6, \"Protocol Layer\") that enables Messages to be exchanged between a Source Port and a Sink Port.  A PHY Layer (see Section 5, \"Physical Layer\") that handles transmission and reception of bits on the wire and handles data transmission Provider Consumer Device Policy Device Policy Manager Manager Policy Engine Policy Engine Protocol Protocol Physical Layer Physical Layer CC Additionally, USB Power Delivery devices which can operate as USB devices can communicate over USB (see Figure 2.4, \"USB Power Delivery Communication Over USB\").

It is a Mode of operation that can be entered only when an Explicit Contract is in place and both the Ports and the Cable Plug(s) support EPR. Entry into EPR Mode follows a strict process; this assures that the higher voltages, at power levels above 100W, are only transferred between known EPR Capable Sources and EPR Capable Sinks over EPR Capable cables. EPR Sources are capable of both Fixed Supply and Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) operation. Maintaining EPR Mode operation also requires maintaining a regular cadence of USB PD communications; loss of communications between the EPR Source and EPR Sink will cause a Hard Reset to be initiated resulting in a return to SPR operation. The EPR Mode entry, operational and exit process is summarized by the following steps: 1) Negotiate and enter into an Explicit Contract in the Standard Power Range. During this step, EPR Capable Sources and Sinks will declare their supported EPR Capabilities through PDO/APDO and RDO exchanges. 2) An EPR Sink, having discovered an EPR Source, can request EPR Mode entry. 3) The EPR Source, having already confirmed that the Attached cable assembly is EPR Capable during the First Explicit Contract Negotiation, will respond to the EPR Sink with an acknowledgment of the EPR Mode entry request. 4) While in EPR Mode: a) The EPR Source sends EPR Capabilities (Fixed Supply PDOs and an AVS APDO) to the EPR Sink which requires the Sink to evaluate and respond as appropriate to adjust the Explicit Contract. b) The EPR Sink maintains a regular cadence of communications with the EPR Source to allow EPR Mode to continue. 5) When either the EPR Source or EPR Sink no longer wants to remain in EPR Mode operation, a normal exit from EPR Mode will first require adjusting the Explicit Contract to a voltage of 20V or lower (SPR (A)PDO) followed by an explicit EPR Mode exit request. a) Source initiated: EPR Source sends an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message that only includes SPR voltages to force the EPR Sink to drop to 20V or below followed by the EPR Mode exit. Once EPR Mode is exited, a new SPR Contract is Negotiated to return to SPR Mode operation. b) Sink initiated; EPR Sink requests a drop to 20V or below followed by the EPR Mode exit. Once EPR Mode is exited, a new SPR Contract is Negotiated to return to SPR Mode operation. operational flow. In this example, at some time during the EPR Mode operation, the Source decides that it needs to exit EPR Mode, so it resends the EPR Capabilities to the Sink with only SPR (A)PDOs to cause the Sink to Negotiate an SPR Contract of 20V or lower and then the Source follows with an EPR Mode exit Message. Once EPR Mode is exited, a new SPR Contract is Negotiated to return to SPR Mode operation. EPR Source EPR Cable EPR Sink Establish SPR Contract (Source/Sink EPR Status) Enter EPR Mode?

EPR Mode Establish EPR Contract (20V or less) Exit Phase Exit EPR Mode Establish SPR Contract (Source/Sink EPR Status) Not illustrated in Figure 2.6, \"Example of a Normal EPR Mode Operational Flow\", while in EPR Mode operation, the Sink might decide it wants to exit EPR Mode. In this case, the Sink must initiate the exit process by revising its Explicit Contract with the Source at 20V or less followed with an EPR_Mode exit Message. Once EPR Mode is exited, a new SPR Contract is Negotiated to formalize the return to SPR Mode operation.

After detection of the Specification Revision to be used, all PD communications Shall comply completely with the relevant Revision of the PD specification. The 2-bit Specification Revision field of a GoodCRC Message does not carry any meaning and Shall be considered as don't care by the recipient of the Message. The sender of a GoodCRC Message Shall set the Specification Revision field to 01b (Revision 2.0) when responding to a Message that contains 01b in the Specification Revision field of the Message Header. The sender of a GoodCRC Message May set the Specification Revision field to 01b or 10b when responding to a Message that contains 10b (Revision 3.x) in the Specification Revision field of the Message Header. The Specification Revision field Shall apply to all SOP* Packet types. An Attach event or a Hard Reset Shall cause the detection of the applicable Specification Revision to be performed for both Ports and Cable Plugs according to the rules stated below: When the Source Port first communicates with the Sink Port the Specification Revision field Shall be used as described by the following steps: 1) The Source Port sends a Source_Capabilities Message to the Sink Port setting the Specification Revision field to the highest Revision of the Power Delivery Specification the Source Port supports. 2) The Sink Port responds with a Request Message setting the Specification Revision field to the highest Revision of the Power Delivery Specification the Sink Port supports that is equal to or lower than the Specification Revision received from the Source Port. 3) The Source and Sink Ports Shall use the Specification Revision in the Request Message from the Sink in step 2 in all subsequent communications until a Detach, Hard Reset, or Error Recovery happens. Prior to entering the First Explicit Contract, the VCONN Source Shall use the following steps to establish a Specification Revision level: 1) The VCONN Source sends a Discover Identity REQ to the Cable Plug (SOP’) setting the Specification Revision field in the Message to the highest Revision of the Power Delivery Specification the VCONN Source supports. After a VCONN Swap the required Soft_Reset / Accept Message exchange is used for the same purpose (see Section 6.3.13, \"Soft Reset Message\"). 2) The Cable Plug responds with a Discover Identity ACK setting the Specification Revision field in the Message to the highest Revision of the Power Delivery Specification the VCONN Source supports that is equal to or lower than the Specification Revision it received from the Source Port. 3) The Cable Plug and VCONN Source Shall communicate using the lower of the two revisions until an Explicit Contract has been established. 4) Table 6.2, \"Revision Interoperability during an Explicit Contract\" shows the Specification Revision that Shall be used between the Port Partners and the Cable Plugs when the Specification Revision has been discovered and an Explicit Contract is in place. Notes:  A VCONN Source that does not communicate with the Cable Plug(s) May skip the above procedure.  When a Cable Plug does not respond to a Revision 3.x Discover Identity REQ with a Discover Identity ACK or BUSY the VCONN Source May repeat steps 1-4 using a Revision 2.0 Discover Identity REQ in step"}

There are three types of Power Data Objects. They contain additional information beyond that encoded in the Message Header to identify each of the three types of Power Data Objects:  Fixed Supply is used to expose well-regulated fixed voltage power supplies.  Variable Supply is used to expose very poorly regulated power supplies.  Battery Supply is used to expose batteries that can be directly connected to VBUS. There are three types of Augmented Power Data Objects:  SPR PPS is used to expose a power supply whose output voltage can be programmatically adjusted over the Advertised voltage range and limited by the Source to a programmable current limit.  SPR AVS and EPR AVS are used to expose a power supply whose output voltage can be adjusted over the Advertised voltage range but otherwise is equivalent to a Fixed Supply (AVS does not support a programmable current limit). Power Data Objects are also used to expose additional Capabilities that May be utilized, such as in the case of a Power Role Swap. A list of one or more Power Data Objects Shall be sent by the Source to convey its Capabilities. The Sink May then request one of these Capabilities by returning a Request Data Object that contains an index to a Power Data Object, to Negotiate a mutually agreeable Explicit Contract. Where Maximum and Minimum voltage and current values are given in PDOs these Shall be taken to be absolute values. The Source and Sink Shall Not Negotiate a power level that would allow the current to exceed the maximum current supported by their receptacles or the Attached plug (see [USB Type-C 2.4]). The Source Shall limit its offered Capabilities to the maximum current supported by its receptacle and Attached plug. A Sink Shall only make a request from any of the Capabilities offered by the Source. For further details see Section 4.4, \"Cable Type Detection\". Sources expose their power Capabilities by sending a Source_Capabilities Message. Sinks expose their power requirements by sending a Sink_Capabilities Message.

Sources whose Port Reported PDP is less than their Port Present PDP (see Section 6.4.11, \"Source_Info Message\") Shall respond to the Requests with the Capability Mismatch bit set as follows. The Source within tCapabilitiesMismatchResponse of the PS_RDY Message Shall send a new Source Capabilities Message that offers either: 1) The set of Source Capabilities to minimally satisfy the Sink's requirements based on what it actually requires for full operation by evaluating the: a) Sink_Capabilities_Extended Message(if supported by the Sink) and/or b) Sink_Capabilities or EPR_Sink_Capabilities Message. 2) The set of Source Capabilities the Source can supply at this time based on the Port Present PDP. To prevent looping, Sources Should Not send a new Source Capabilities Message in response to subsequent Request Message with the Capability Mismatch flag set until its Port Present PDP changes. Once a Guaranteed Capability Source that has responded to a Capability Mismatch, it Shall Not subsequently send out another Source Capabilities Message at a lower PDP unless the power required by the Sink (as indicated in its Sink Capabilities Message or Sink_Capabilities_Extended Message) has also been reduced. Sources wishing to manage their power May periodically check the Sink Capabilities Message or Sink_Capabilities_Extended Message to determine whether these have changed. Note: A Source Capabilities Message refers to a Source_Capabilities Message or an EPR_Source_Capabilities Message, and a Sink Capabilities Message refers to a Sink_Capabilities Message or EPR_Sink_Capabilities Message, Request refers to a Request Message or EPR_Request depending on operating mode. In this context a Valid Request Message means the following:  The Object Position field Shall contain a reference to an object that was present in the last received Source Capabilities Message.  The Operating Current/Operating Power field Shall contain a value which is less than or equal to the maximum current/power offered by the selected (A)PDO the Source Capabilities Message."}

To minimize calculations after the initial Attachment, a Port can also use a digest consisting of hashes of the certificates rather than the certificates themselves.

A Source which receives a request for current below iPpsCLMin Should reject the request. A Source that accepts a request for current below iPpsCLMin Shall set its current limit at 1A. The response of an SPR PPS to a load change depends on the Operating mode of the SPR PPS and the magnitude of the load change. These dependencies lead to one of four possible responses of an SPR PPS to any load change.

This safe Sink requirement Shall apply to all Sinks operating with a Negotiated VBUS level greater than vSafe5V and Shall apply during all low power and high-power operating modes of the Sink. If the Detach is detected during a Sink low power state, such as USB Suspend, the Sink can then draw as much power as needed from its bulk capacitance since a Source is no longer Attached. In order to achieve a successful Detach detect based on VBUS voltage level droop, the Sink power consumption Shall be high enough so that VBUS will decay below vSrcValid(min) well within tSafe5V after the Source bulk capacitance is removed due to the Detach. Once adequate VBUS droop has been achieved, a discharge circuit can be enabled to meet the safe Sink requirement. To illustrate the point, the following set of Sink conditions will not meet the safe Sink requirement without additional discharge circuitry:  Negotiated VBUS = 20V.  Maximum allowable supplied VBUS voltage = 21.55V.  Maximum bulk capacitance = 30µF.  Power consumption at Detach = 12.5mW. When the Detach occurs (hence removal of the Source bulk capacitance) the 12.5mW power consumption will draw down the VBUS voltage from the worst-case maximum level of 21.55V to 17V in approximately 205ms. At this point, with VBUS well below vSrcValid (min) an approximate 100mW discharge circuit can be enabled to increase the rate of Sink bulk capacitance discharge and meet the safe Sink requirement. The power level of the discharge circuit is dependent on how much time is left to discharge the remaining voltage on the Sink bulk capacitance. If a Sink has the ability to detect the Detach in a different manner and in much less time than tSafe5V, then this different manner of detection can be used to enable a discharge circuit, allowing even lower power dissipation during low power modes such as USB Suspend. In most applications, the safe Sink requirement will limit the maximum Sink bulk capacitance well below the cSnkBulkPd limit. A Detach occurring during Sink high power operating modes must quickly discharge the Sink bulk capacitance to vSafe5V or lower as long as the Sink continues to draw adequate power until VBUS has decayed to vSafe5V or lower."}

{"doc_title":"USB Power Delivery Specification Rev 3.2","section_id":"8.2","title":"Device Policy Manager","page":417,"level":2,"parent_id":"8","full_path":"8.2 Device Policy Manager","tags":[],"content":"The Device Policy Manager is responsible for managing the power used by one or more USB Power Delivery ports. In order to have sufficient knowledge to complete this task it needs relevant information about the device it resides in. Firstly, it has a priori knowledge of the device including the Capabilities of the power supply and the receptacles on each Port since these will for example have specific current ratings. It also has to know information from the USB-C® Port Control module regarding cable insertion, type and rating of cable etc. It also has to have information from the power supply about changes in its Capabilities as well as being able to request power supply changes. With all of this information the Device Policy Manager is able to provide up to date information regarding the Capabilities available to a specific Port and to manage the power resources within the device. When working out the Capabilities for a given Source Port the Device Policy Manager will take into account firstly the current rating of the Port's receptacle and whether the inserted cable is PD or non-PD rated and if so, what is the capability of the plug. This will set an upper bound for the Capabilities which might be offered. After this the Device Policy Manager will consider the available power supply resources since this will bound which voltages and currents might be offered. Finally, the Device Policy Manager will consider what power is currently allocated to other ports, which power is in the Power Reserve and any other amendments to Policy from the System Policy Manager. The Device Policy Manager will offer a set of Capabilities within the bounds detailed above. When selecting a capability for a given Sink Port the Device Policy Manager will look at the Capabilities offered by the Source. This will set an upper bound for the Capabilities which might be requested. The Device Policy Manager will also consider which Capabilities are required by the Sink in order to operate. If an appropriate match for voltage and Current can be found within the limits of the receptacle and cable, then this will be requested from the Source. If an appropriate match cannot be found then a request for an offered voltage and current will be made, along with an indication of a Capabilities Mismatch. USB PD defines two types of power sources:  Predefined voltage sources (Fixed Supply, Variable Supply and Battery Supply)  Programmable voltage sources:  Programmable Power Supply (PPS)  Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) The first are generally used for classic charging wherein the Charger electronics reside inside the Sink. The Device Policy Manager in the Sink requests a fixed voltage from the list of PDOs offered by the Source and which is converted internally to charge the Sink's Battery and/or power its function. The second moves the Charger electronics that manage the voltage control outside the Sink and back into the Source itself. When in SPR PPS Mode, the Device Policy Manager in the Sink requests a specific voltage with a 20mV accuracy and sets a current limit. Unlike traditional USB where Sinks are responsible for limiting the current, they consume, the SPR PPS Source limits the current to what the Sink has requested. When operating in, the Device Policy Manager in the Sink requests a specific voltage with a 100mV accuracy and requests a maximum current it is allowed to draw. Note: The AVS Sources unlike SPR PPS Sources do not support current limit mode. A Sink operating in is respon sible not to draw more current than it requests. The process to request power is the same for both types of power Sources although the actual format and contents of the request are slightly different. The primary operational differences are:  A Sink that is using SPR PPS is required to periodically sent requests to let the Source know it is still alive and communicating. When this communication fails a Hard Reset results.  A Sink operating in SPR Mode has no special timing requirements.  A Sink operating in EPR Mode is required to periodically communicate with the Source to let it know it is still operational. If the communication fails, a Hard Reset results. For Dual-Role Power Ports the Device Policy Manager manages the functionality of both a Source and a Sink. In addition, it is able to manage the Power Role Swap process between the two. In terms of power management this could mean that a Port which is initially consuming power as a Sink is able to become a power resource as a Source. Conversely, Attached Sources might request that power be provided to them. The functionality within the Device Policy Manager (and to a certain extent the Policy Engine) is scalable depending on the complexity of the device, including the number of different power supply Capabilities and the number of different features supported for example System Policy Manager interface or Capabilities Mismatch, and the number of ports being managed. Within these parameters it is possible to implement devices from very simple power supplies to more complex power supplies or devices such as USB Hubs or Hard Drives. Within multi-Port devices it is also permitted to have a combination of USB Power Delivery and non-USB Power Delivery ports which Should all be managed by the Device Policy Manager. As noted in Section 2.6, \"Architectural Overview\" the logical architecture used in the PD specification will vary depending on the implementation. This means that different implementations of the Device Policy Manager might be relatively small or large depending on the complexity of the device, as indicated above. It is also possible to allocate different responsibilities between the Policy Engine and the Device Policy Manager, which will lead to different types of architectures and interfaces. The Device Policy Manager is responsible for the following:  Maintaining the Local Policy for the device.  For a Source, monitoring the present Capabilities and triggering notifications of the change.  For a Sink, evaluating and responding to Capabilities related requests from the Policy Engine for a given Port.  Control of the Source/Sink in the device.  Control of the USB-C® Port Control module for each Port.  Interface to the Policy Engine for a given Port. The Device Policy Manager is responsible for the following Optional features when implemented:  Communications with the System Policy over USB.  For Sources with multiple ports monitoring and balancing power requirements across these ports.  Monitoring of batteries and AC power supplies.  Managing Modes in its Port Partner and Cable Plug(s)."}

A device that sets the Unconstrained Power bit has either an external source of power that is sufficient to adequately power the system while charging external devices or expects to charge external devices as a primary state of function (such as a battery pack). In the case of the external power source, the power can either be from an AC Supply directly connected to the device or from an AC Supply connected to an Attached device, which is also getting unconstrained power from its power supply. The Unconstrained Power bit is in this way communicated through a PD system indicating that the origin of the power is from a single or multiple AC supplies, from a battery bank, or similar:  If the \"Unconstrained Power\" bit is set, then that power is originally sourced from an AC Supply.  Devices capable of consuming on multiple ports can only claim that they have \"Unconstrained Power\" for the power Advertised as a Provider Port if there is unconstrained power beyond that needed for nor mal operation coming from external supplies, (e.g., multiple AC supplies).  This concept applies as the power is routed through multiple Provider and Consumer tiers, so, as an ex ample. Power provided out of a monitor that is connected to a monitor that gets power from an AC Sup ply, will claim it has \"Unconstrained Power\" even though it is not directly connected to the AC Supply. An example use case is a Tablet computer that is used with two USB A/V displays that are daisy chained (see Figure 8.1, \"Example of daisy chained displays\"). The tablet and 1st display are not externally powered, (meaning, they have no source of power outside of USB PD). The 2nd display has an external supply Attached which could either be a USB PD based supply or some other form of external supply. When the displays are connected as shown, the power adapter Attached to the 2nd display is able to power both the 1st display and the tablet. In this case the 2nd display will indicate the presence of a sufficiently sized Charger to the 1st display, by setting its \"Unconstrained Power\" bit. The 1st display will then in turn assess and indicate the presence of the extra power to the tablet by setting its \"Unconstrained Power\" bit. Power is transmitted through the system to all devices, provided that there is sufficient power available from the external supply. Tablet Display 1 Display 2 AC Another example use case is a laptop computer that is Attached to both an external supply and a Tablet computer. In this situation, if the external supply is large enough to power the laptop in its normal state as well as charge an external device, the laptop would set its \"Unconstrained Power\" bit and the tablet will allow itself to charge at its peak rate. If the external supply is small, however, and would not prevent the laptop from discharging if maximal power is drawn by the external device, the laptop would not set its \"Unconstrained Power\" bit, and the tablet can choose to draw less than what is offered. This amount could be just enough to prevent the tablet from discharging, or none at all. Alternatively, if the tablet determines that the laptop has significantly larger battery with more charge than the tablet has, the tablet can still choose to charge itself, although possibly not at the maximal rate. In this way, Sinks that do not receive the Unconstrained Power bit from the connected Source can still choose to charge their batteries, or charge at a reduced rate, if their policy determines that the impact to the Source is minimal -- such as in the case of a phone with a small battery charging from a laptop with a large battery. These policies can be decided via further USB PD communication."}

A simplified algorithm is detailed below to ensure that Battery powered devices will get charge from non-Battery powered devices when possible, and also to ensure that devices do not constantly Power Role Swap back and forth. When two devices are connected that do not have Unconstrained Power, they Should define their own policies so as to prevent constant Power Role Swapping.

An AMS Shall be defined as a Message sequence that starts and/or ends in either the PE_SRC_Ready, PE_SNK_Ready or PE_CBL_Ready states (see Section 8.3.3.2, \"Policy Engine Source Port State Diagram\", Section 8.3.3.3, \"Policy Engine Sink Port State Diagram\" and Section 8.3.3.25, \"Cable Plug Specific State Diagrams\"). In addition, the Cable Plug discovery sequence specified in Section 8.3.3.25.3, \"Source Startup Structured VDM Discover Identity of a Cable Plug State Diagram\" Shall be defined as an AMS. The Source and Sink indicate to the Protocol Layer when an AMS starts and ends on entry to/exit from PE_SRC_Ready or PE_SNK_Ready (see Section 8.3.3.2, \"Policy Engine Source Port State Diagram\" and Section 8.3.3.3, \"Policy Engine Sink Port State Diagram\"). An AMS Shall be considered to have been started by the Initiator when the protocol engine signals the Policy Engine that transmission is a success (the GoodCRC Message has been received in response to the initial Message). For the receiving Port the AMS Shall be considered to have started when the initial Message has arrived. An AMS Shall be considered to have ended:  When the Protocol Layer signals the Policy Engine that transmission of the final Message in the AMS is a success and for the opposite Port when the final Message has been received.  A Soft_Reset Message, Hard Reset Signaling for SOP’ or SOP’’ or Cable Reset Signaling has been sent or received. Section 8.3.2.1.3, \"Atomic Message Sequences\" gives details of these AMS's. This section contains sequence diagrams that highlight some of the more interesting transactions. It is by no means a complete summary of all possible combinations but is Informative in nature."}

In this case the outgoing Message is removed from the queue and the incoming Message processed. 2) Due to some sort of noise on the line it is not possible to transmit. In this case the outgoing Message is Discarded by the PHY Layer. Retransmission is via the Protocol Layer’s normal mechanism. B 1) Message does not arrive at the PHY Layer due to noise on the channel. 2) Message arrives but has been corrupted and has a bad CRC. There is no Message to pass up to the Protocol Layer on the receiver which means a GoodCRC Message is not sent. This leads to a CRCReceiveTimer timeout in the Message Sender. C 1) MessageID of received Message matches stored MessageID so this is a retry. Message is not passed up to the Policy Engine. D 1) Policy Engine receives a known Message that it was not expecting. 2) Policy Engine receives an Unrecognized Message. These cases are errors in the protocol which could lead to the generation of a Soft_Reset Message. E Same as point A but at the Message Receiver side. Point Possible issues F 1) GoodCRC Message response does not arrive at the Message Sender side due to the noise on the channel. 2) GoodCRC Message response arrives but has a bad CRC. A GoodCRC Message is not received by the Message Sender’s Protocol Layer. This leads to a CRCReceiveTimer timeout in the Message Sender. G 1) GoodCRC Message is received but does contain the same MessageID as the transmitted Message. 2) A Message is received but it is not a GoodCRC Message (similar case to that of an unexpected or unknown Message but this time detected in the Protocol Layer). Both of these issues indicate errors in receiving an expected GoodCRC Message which will lead to a CRCReceiveTimer timeout in the Protocol Layer and a subsequent retry (except for communications with Cable Plugs). with a retry due to a bad CRC at the Message Receiver. It starts when the Message Sender's Protocol Layer at the behest of its Policy Engine forms a Message that it passes to the PHY Layer. The Protocol Layer is responsible for retries on a “'n' strikes and you are out\" basis (nRetryCount). Table 8.3, \"Basic Message Flow with CRC failure\" details the steps in the flow. Message Sender Message Receiver : Policy Engine : Protocol : PHY : PHY : Protocol : Policy Engine 1: Send message 2: Message 3: Message + CRC Start CRCReceiveTimer Message is not received or CRC is bad so message is not passed to the protocol layer CRCReceiveTimer expires Retry and increment RetryCounter 4: Message 5: Message + CRC 6: Message Start CRCReceiveTimer Check MessageID against local copy Store copy of MessageID 8: GoodCRC 7: Message received 10: GoodCRC 9: GoodCRC + CRC Consume message Check and increment MessageIDCounter Reset RetryCounter Stop CRCReceiveTimer 11: Message sent Step Message Sender Message Receiver"}

It does not include any subsequent Power Negotiation which is required in order to establish an Explicit Contract (see Section 8.3.2.2, \"Power Negotiation\"). There are several distinct phases to the Fast Role Swap Negotiation:  The Initial Source stops driving its power output which starts transitioning to vSafe0V and send the Fast Role Swap Request on the CC wire; these could occur in either order or simultaneously.  The Initial Sink stops sinking power. At this point the New Source still has Rd asserted and the New Sink still has Rp asserted.  An FR_Swap Message is sent by the New Source within tFRSwapInit of detecting the Fast Swap signal.  An Accept Message is sent by the New Sink in response to the FR_Swap Message.  The New Sink asserts Rd and sends a PS_RDY Message indicating that the voltage on VBUS is at or below vSafe5V.  The New Source asserts Rp and sends a PS_RDY Message indicating that it is acting as a Source and is sup plying vSafe5V. Note: The New Source can start applying VBUS when VBUS is at or below vSafe5V (max) but will start driving VBUS to vSafe5V no later than tSrcFRSwap after detecting both the Fast Role Swap Request and that VBUS has dropped below vSafe5V (min). devices to accomplish the Fast Role Swap.

{"doc_title":"USB Power Delivery Specification Rev 3.2","section_id":"8.3.3.1","title":"Introduction to state diagrams used in Chapter","page":822,"level":4,"parent_id":"8.3.3","full_path":"8.3.3.1 Introduction to state diagrams used in Chapter","tags":[],"content":"The state diagrams defined in Section 8.3.3, \"State Diagrams\" are Normative and Shall define the operation of the Power Delivery Policy Engine. Note: These state diagrams are not intended to replace a well written and robust design. <Name of State> Actions on entry: “List of actions to carry out on entering the state” Actions on exit: “List of actions to carry out on exiting the state” Power (VI) = “Present power level” PD = “attachment status” the name of the state. This is followed by \"Actions on entry\" a list of actions carried out on entering the state. If there are also \"Actions on exit\" a list of actions carried out on exiting the state, then these are listed as well; otherwise, this box is omitted from the state. At the bottom the status of PD is listed:  “Power\" which indicates the present output power for a Source Port or input power for a Sink Port.  “PD\" which indicates the present Attachment status either \"Attached\", \"Detached\", or \"unknown\". Transitions from one state to another are indicated by arrows with the conditions listed on the arrow. Where there are multiple conditions, these are connected using either a logical OR \"|\" or a logical AND \"&\". In some cases, there are transitions which can occur from any state to a particular state. These are indicated by an arrow which is unconnected to a state at one end, but with the other end (the point) connected to the final state. In some state diagrams it is necessary to enter or exit from states in other diagrams (e.g., Source Port or Sink Port state diagrams). Figure 8.128, \"References to states\" indicates how such references are made. The reference is indicated with a hatched box. The box contains the name of the state and whether the state is a DFP or UFP. It has also been necessary to indicate conditional entry to either Source Port or Sink Port state diagrams. This is achieved by the use of a bulleted list indicating the preconditions (see example in Figure 8.129, \"Example of state reference with conditions\"). It is also possible that the entry and return states are the same. Figure 8.130, \"Example of state reference with the same entry and exit\" indicates a state reference where each referenced state corresponds to either the entry state or the exit state. <Name of reference state> (<DFP | UFP>) Hard Reset: • Consumer or Consumer/Provider -> PE_SNK_.... • Provider/Consumer in Source role -> PE_SRC_... <Name of reference state 1> or <Name of reference state 2> (<DFP | UFP>) Timers are included in many of the states. Timers are initialized (set to their starting condition) and run (timer is counting) in the particular state it is referenced. As soon as the state is exited then the timer is no longer active. Where the timers continue to run outside of the state (such as the NoResponseTimer), this is called out in the text. Timeouts of the timers are listed as conditions on state transitions. The SenderResponseTimer is a special case, as it May be stopped and started from outside the states in which it is used. To allow this to be done without over-complicating the state diagrams, the SenderResponseTimer is described with its own state diagram (Figure 8.131, \"SenderResponseTimer Policy Engine State Diagram\"). The control of this Timer is shared between the Policy Engine and the Chunking Layer. Conditions listed on state transitions will come from one of three sources and, when there is a conflict, Should be serviced in the following order: 1) Message and related indications passed up to the Policy Engine from the Protocol Layer (Message sent; Message received etc.). 2) Events triggered within the Policy Engine e.g., timer timeouts. 3) Information and requests coming from the Device Policy Manager relating either to Local Policy, or to other modules which the Device Policy Manager controls such as power supply and USB-C® Port Control. Note: The following state diagrams are not intended to cover all possible corner cases that could be encountered. For example, where an outgoing Message is Discarded, due to an incoming Message by the Protocol Layer (see Section 6.12.2.3, \"Protocol Layer Message Reception\") it will be necessary for the higher layers of the system to handle a retry of the AMS that was being initiated, after first handling the incoming Message."}

In the case where this is not implemented the Source Shall continue to send Source_Capabilities Messages each time the SourceCapabilityTimer times out. 2) Since the Sink is required to make a Valid request from the offered capabilities the expected transition is via \"Request can be met\" unless the Source Capabilities have changed since the last offer. 3) “Contract Invalid\" means that the previously Negotiated voltage and Current values are no longer included in the Source's new Capabilities. If the Sink fails to make a Valid Request in this case, then Power Delivery operation is no lon ger possible and Power Delivery mode is exited with a Hard Reset. 4) After a Power Swap the New Source is required to wait an additional tSwapSourceStart before sending a Source_Capabilities Message. This delay is not required when first starting up a system. 5) PD Connected is defined as a situation when the Port Partners are actively communicating. The Port Partners remain PD Connected after a Swap until there is a transition to Disabled or the connector is able to identify a Detach. 6) Port Partners are no longer PD Connected after a Hard Reset, but consideration needs to be given as to whether there has been a PD Connection while the Ports have been Attached to prevent unnecessary USB Type-C Error Recovery. 7) The DiscoverIdentityTimer is run when this is a VCONN Source and a PD Connection with a Cable Plug needs to be es tablished i.e. no GoodCRC Message has yet been received in response to a Discover Identity Command. 8) See Section 5.7, \"Collision Avoidance\", Section 6.6.16, \"Collision Avoidance Timers\" and Section 6.10, \"Collision Avoidance\". 9) In the PE_SRC_Wait_New_Capabilities State the Device Policy Manager Should either decide to send no further Source Capabilities or Should send a different set of Source Capabilities. Continuing to send the same set of Source Capabilities could result in a live lock situation. 10) The SourcePPSCommTimer is only initialized and run when the present Explicit Contract is for an SPR PPS APDO. Sourc es that do not support SPR PPS do not need to implement the SourcePPSCommTimer. 11) The SourceEPRKeepAliveTimer is only initialized and run when the Source is in EPR Mode; Sources that do not support EPR Mode do not need to implement the SourceEPRKeepAliveTimer. 12) Either SPR or EPR Sink Capabilities May be requested, regardless of whether or not the Source is currently operating in SPR or EPR Mode."}

{"doc_title":"USB Power Delivery Specification Rev 3.2","section_id":"9.1","title":"Overview","page":975,"level":2,"parent_id":"9","full_path":"9.1 Overview","tags":[],"content":"This chapter describes the Status reporting mechanisms for devices with data connections (e.g., D+/D- and or SSTx+/- and SSRx+/-). It also describes the corresponding USB state a device that supports USB PD Shall transition to as a result of changes to the USB PD state that the device is in. This chapter does not define the System Policy or the System Policy Manager. That is defined in [UCSI]. In addition, the Policies themselves are not described here; these are left to the implementers of the relevant products and systems to define. All PD Capable USB (PDUSB) Devices Shall report themselves as self-powered devices (over USB) when plugged into a PD capable Port even if they are entirely powered from VBUS. However, there are some differences between PD and [USB 2.0] / [USB 3.2]; for example, the presence of VBUS alone does not mean that the device (Consumer) moves from the USB Attached State to the USB Powered State. Similarly, the removal of VBUS alone does not move the device (Consumer) from any of the USB states to the USB Attached State. See Section 9.1.2, \"Mapping to USB Device States\" for details. PDUSB Devices Shall follow the PD requirements when it comes to suspend (see Section 6.4.1.2.1.2, \"USB Suspend Supported\"), configured, and operational power. The PD requirements when the device is configured or operational are defined in this section (see Table 9.4, \"PD Consumer Port Descriptor\"). Note: The power requirements reported in the PD Consumer Port descriptor of the device Shall override the power draw reported in the bMaxPower field in the configuration descriptor. A PDUSB Device Shall report zero in the bMaxPower field after successfully negotiating a mutually agreeable Explicit Contract and Shall disconnect and re-enumerate when it switches operation back to operating in standard [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB4], [USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2]. When operating in [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2] mode it Shall report its power draw via the bMaxPower field. Each Provider and Consumer will have their own Local Policies which operate between Port Partners. An example of a typical PD system is shown in Figure 9.1, \"Example PD Topology\". This example consists of a Provider, Consumer/Providers and Consumers connected together in a tree topology. Between directly connected devices there is both a flow of Power and also Communication consisting of both Status and Control information. AC/Battery Power Provider PD Communication P/C Provider/Consumer Consumer/ Provider P/C P/C P/C Consumer Consumer Consumer/ AC/Battery Provider AC/Battery Power Root Hub PD Communication Hub AC/Battery Device Device Device In a USB based system, policy is managed by the host and communication of system level policy information is via standard USB data line communication. This is a separate mechanism to the USB Power Delivery VBUS protocol which is used to manage Local Policy. When USB Communication is used, status information and control requests are passed directly between the System Policy Manager (SPM) on the host and the Provider or Consumer. See Figure 9.3, \"Use of SPM in the PD System\". AC/Battery Power Host (SPM) PD Communication USB Communication Hub AC/Battery Device Device Device Status information comes from a Provider or Consumer to the SPM so it can better manage the resources on the host and provide feedback to the end user. Real systems will be a mixture of devices which in terms of power management support might have implemented PD, [USB 2.0], [USB 3.2], [USB4], [USB Type-C 2.4] or [USBBC 1.2] or they might even just be non-compliant “power sucking devices”. The level of communication of system status to the SPM will therefore not necessarily be comprehensive. The aim of the status mechanisms described here is to provide a mechanism whereby each connected entity in the system provides as much information as possible on the status of itself. Information described in this section that is communicated to the SPM is as follows:  Versions of USB Type-C®, PD and BC supported.  Capabilities as a Provider/Consumer.  Current operational state of each Port e.g. Standard, USB Type-C Current, BC, PD and Negotiated power level.  Status of AC or Battery Power for each PDUSB Device in the system. The SPM can Negotiate with Providers or Consumers in the system in order to request a different Local Policy, or to request the amount of power to be delivered by the Provider to the Consumer. Any change in Local Policy could trigger a Re-negotiation of the Explicit Contract, using USB Power Delivery protocols, between a directly connected Provider and Consumer. A change in how much power is available can, for example, cause a Re-negotiation."}

Environmental considerations could result in unbundled power adapters. Rules are needed to avoid incompatibility between the Sources and the Sinks they are used to power, in order to avoid user confusion and to meet user expectations. This section specifies a set of rules that Sources and Sinks Shall follow. These rules provide a simple and consistent user experience. The PDP Rating is a manufacturer declared value placed on packaging to help the user understand the capabilities of a Charger or the size of Charger required to power their device. For PDP values of 10W and above the PDP Shall be declared as an integer number of Watts. For PDP values less than 10W, the PDP Shall be declared in increments of 0.5W. The Source Power Rules define a PDP to provide a simple way to tell the user about the capabilities of their power adapter or device. PDP Rating is akin to the wattage rating of a light bulb - bigger numbers mean more capability. The Sink Power Rules define a PDP to provide a simple way to tell the user which Sources will provide adequate power for their Sink."}

For all of the defined rules, the capabilities a Source exposes are based on the Port Maximum PDP, or if power constrained, the Port Present PDP of the Port. For a Guaranteed Capability Port, the Source Shall always include in every Source_Capabilities or EPR_Source_Capabilities Message sent to a Sink all the (A)PDOs that are defined by the Normative (and Optional when implemented) rules based on the Port’s Port Maximum PDP and Mode of operation (i.e., SPR Mode or EPR Mode). For a Managed Capability Port, except before the First Explicit Contract or before the Explicit Contract after the Port Present PDP changes on a Shared Capacity Charger Port, the Source Shall always include in every Source_Capabilities or EPR_Source_Capabilities Message sent to a Sink all the (A)PDOs that are defined by the Normative (and Optional when implemented) rules based on the Port’s Port Present PDP and Mode of operation (i.e., SPR Mode or EPR Mode). After the First Explicit Contract, this requirement assures that the attached Sink will always know what voltages (or voltage modes) are presently available from the Source. In order to meet the expectations of the user, the Maximum Current/Power in the Source Capabilities PDO or APDO for Sources with a PDP Rating of x Watts Shall be as follows:  Maximum current for Normative and Optional Fixed Supply/Variable Supply PDOs Shall be either RoundUp(x/voltage) or RoundDown(x/voltage) to the nearest 10mA.  Maximum current for SPR Programmable Power Supply APDOs Shall be as defined in Table 10.10, \"SPR Programmable Power Supply PDOs and APDOs based on the Port Maximum PDP\". Note: When the Constant Power bit is set in the APDO, the programmable power supply's output current is as defined in Table 10.10, \"SPR Programmable Power Supply PDOs and APDOs based on the Port Maximum PDP\" however the programmable power supply will limit its output current so that the product of its actual output voltage times the output current does not exceed the PDP.  If a 9V Prog, 15V Prog or 20V Prog Programmable Power Supply APDO is Advertised when not required by Table 10.10, \"SPR Programmable Power Supply PDOs and APDOs based on the Port Maximum PDP\", then the maximum current Shall be RoundDown (x/Prog Voltage) to the nearest 50mA.

Considerations Rationale Consequence Simple to identify capability A user going into an electronics retailer Cannot have a complex identification knows what they need scheme Higher power Sources are a superset of Bigger is always better in user’s eyes – don’t Higher power Sources do everything smaller smaller ones want a degradation in performance ones do Sources with the same power rating but Unambiguous Source definitions different VI combinations might not inter- To avoid user confusion, any given power operate rating has a single definition A range of power ratings Users and companies will want freedom to Fixed profiles at specific power levels don’t pick appropriate Source ratings provide adequate flexibility, e.g., profiles as defined in previous versions of PD. 5V@3A USB Type-C Source is defined by [USB Type-C 2.4] 5V@3A USB Type-C Source is considered All > 15W adapters must support 5V@3A or superset consideration is violated Maximize 3A cable utilization 3A cables will be ubiquitous Increase to maximum voltage (20V) before increasing current beyond 3A Optimize voltage rail count More rails are a higher burden for Sources, 5V is a basic USB requirement. 48V provides particularly in terms of testing the maximum capability.

A Sink optimized for a Source with Optional voltages and currents or power as described in Section 10.2.3, \"Optional Voltages/Currents\" with a PDP Rating of x W Shall provide a similar user experience when powered from a Source with a PDP Rating of ≥ x W that supplies only the Normative voltages and currents as specified in Section 10.2.2, \"Normative Voltages and Currents\". For example, a 60W Source might not offer 9V Prog or 15V Prog since 20V Prog is a suitable substitute for both (as shown in Table 10.10, \"SPR Programmable Power Supply PDOs and APDOs based on the Port Maximum PDP\"). The Operational Current/Power in the Sink Capabilities PDO for Sinks with an Operational PDP of x Watts Shall be as follows:  Operational current for Fixed Supply/Variable Supply PDOs: RoundDown(x/voltage) to the nearest 10mA.  Operational power for Battery Supply PDOs: ≤ x.  Operational current for Programmable Power Supply APDOs as defined in Table 10.10, \"SPR Programmable Power Supply PDOs and APDOs based on the Port Maximum PDP\": RoundDown (x/Prog Voltage) to the nearest 50mA.

The DC offset of the BMC signal at Power Source and Power Sink are in the opposite directions. When the VBUS current is increased from 0A, the BMC signal waveform shifts downward at Power Sink and shifts upward at Power Source. This section introduces two sample BMC receiver circuit implementations, which are immune from DC offset and high current load step. They can be used in Power Source, Power Sink and inside cables. D.1 Finite Difference Scheme D.1.1 Sample Circuitry The sample Finite Difference BMC receiver shown in Figure D.1, \"Circuit Block of BMC Finite Difference Receiver\"consists of the Rx bandwidth limiting filter with the time constant tRxFilter, a sampler with the sampling step ΔtS, 50ns, a Finite Difference Calculator which calculates the voltage difference between the time interval of ΔtFD, 300ns, an edge detector controlled by two voltage thresholds, Vth, H and Vth, L and a logic block for bit recognition. Figure D.1 Circuit Block of BMC Finite Difference Receiver D.1.2 Theory This section describes the fundamental theory of Finite Difference Scheme to recover the received BMC signal with the input and output signal waveforms of the circuit blocks shown in Figure D.1, \"Circuit Block of BMC Finite Difference Receiver\". To illustrate the robustness of the implementation, the VBUS current load step rate is intentionally increased to 2A/µs at the Sink load. In Figure D.2, \"BMC AC and DC noise from VBUS at Power Sink\" (a), the red curve represents the VBUS current measured at the Power Sink when the current is increased at 9 µs from 0A to 5A and the blue dash curve represents the VBUS current measured at the USB Type-C ®connector of the power Sink. In this example, the peak current overshoot with larger load step rate is increased to 518 mA which exceeds iOvershoot. Figure D.2, \"BMC AC and DC noise from VBUS at Power Sink\" (b) shows the total BMC noise at Power Sink, coupled from VBUS and D+/D- through the worst [USB Type-C 2.4] compliant cable, after the Rx bandwidth limiting filter with the time constant tRxFilter is applied. The noise can be decomposed into 3 components. The first is the DC offset, IVBUS(t)*RGND, while IVBUS is the VBUS current and RGND is the ground DC resistance of the cable. The offset is negative in Power Sink and positive at Power Source. The second noise component is the inductive VBUS noise, M*d IVBUS(t)/dt, while M is the mutual inductance between the VBUS and CC wires in the cable and d IVBUS(t)/ dt is the load step rate. The third component is [USB 2.0] Full Speed SE0 coupling noise which would normally occur randomly but was assumed to occur periodically in the simulation to account for the crosstalk in any phase between the BMC and [USB 2.0] signals. In Figure D.3, \"Sample BMC Signals (a) without USB 2.0 SE0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 SE0 Noise\", the blue dash curve represents the BMC signal when there is no VBUS current, and the red solid curve represents the BMC signal affected by the VBUS coupling noise shown in Figure D.2, \"BMC AC and DC noise from VBUS at Power Sink\"(b). The green solid curve is the sample [USB 2.0] noise, after the Rx bandwidth limiting filter with the time constant tRxFilter is applied. Figure D.2 BMC AC and DC noise from VBUS at Power Sink Figure D.3 Sample BMC Signals (a) without USB 2.0 SE0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 SE0 Noise The BMC signals shown in Figure D.3, \"Sample BMC Signals (a) without USB 2.0 SE0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 SE0 Noise\" are sampled every 50ns and the scaled derivative waveforms, Vcc(t) - Vcc (t - 50ns), without and with [USB 2.0] noise are shown in Figure D.4, \"Scaled BMC Signal Derivative with 50ns Sampling Rate (a) without USB 2.0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 Noise\" (a) and (b), respectively. In Figure D.4, \"Scaled BMC Signal Derivative with 50ns Sampling Rate (a) without USB 2.0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 Noise\" (a), if there is no [USB 2.0] noise, the derivative waveform just changes slightly before and after the VBUS current transition. That means, the slope of the BMC waveform is not sensitive to the DC offset and is very useful to be used to design a robust receiver against a large DC offset. However, the derivative waveforms with [USB 2.0] noise have large perturbation as shown in Figure D.4, \"Scaled BMC Signal Derivative with 50ns Sampling Rate (a) without USB 2.0 Noise (b) with USB 2.0 Noise\" (b). Figure D.4 Scaled BMC Signal Derivative with 50ns Sampling Rate (a) without USB 2.0 Noise (b) with USB"}

The larger the time interval Δt is, the larger the peak-to-peak magnitude of the Finite Difference Output will be. However, the time interval is bounded by the rise time of the BMC signal so that 300ns to 500ns is a good range of the time interval. Figure D.5 BMC Signal and Finite Difference Output with Various Time Steps D.1.3 Data Recovery The edge detection is followed by the Finite Difference Calculation. At the input of the edge detector, if the voltage is larger than Vth, H at the rising edge, the output will become high voltage level, VH, if the voltage is smaller than Vth, L at the falling edge, the output will become low voltage level, VL. In this example, Vth, H and Vth, L are 0.2V and -0.2V, respectively. The solid curve in Figure D.6, \"Output of Finite Difference in dash line and Edge Detector in solid line\" represents the output of the edge detector, where VH is 0.5V and VL is -0.5V. Figure D.6 Output of Finite Difference in dash line and Edge Detector in solid line The duty cycle of the output signal from the edge detector varies depending on the thresholds, Vth, H and Vth, L, as well as jitter and noise from silicon and channel. The techniques such as integrating receiver can be used to recover the BMC signal. D.1.4 Noise Zone and Detection Zone Figure D.7, \"Noise Zone and Detect Zone of BMC Receiver\" shows the output of Finite Difference when the time interval of Finite Difference is set to 300ns. The noise Zone is defined in between +Vnoise and -Vnoise, in which the noise glitches occur. The detect zone is defined in between +Vdetect and -Vdetect, excluding the noise zone. The thresholds of the edge detectors, Vth, H and Vth, L, must be properly set within the detect zone so that the data can be recovered successfully. In this example, Vdetect is 250mV and Vnoise is 50mV. It is highly recommended that the product implemented with the similar techniques indicates the performance with the range of Vnoise and Vdetect in the electrical specification. Figure D.7 Noise Zone and Detect Zone of BMC Receiver D.2 Subtraction Scheme D.2.1 Sample Circuitry The sample Subtraction BMC receiver shown in Figure D.8, \"Circuit Block of BMC Subtraction Receiver\" consists of the two Low Pass Filters (LPF1 and LPF2), a Subtractor, an Edge Detector and a logic block for bit recognition. The time constant of the first and second LPF are 200ns and 300ns, respectively. The Subtractor subtracts the LPF1 output from the LPF2 output. The Edge Detector controlled by two voltage thresholds, Vth, H and Vth, L to recover the data. Figure D.8 Circuit Block of BMC Subtraction Receiver D.2.2 Output of Each Circuit Block Figure D.9, \"(a) Output of LPF1 and LPF2 (b) Subtraction of LPF1 and LPF2 Output\" (a) shows the output of LPF1 as the red solid line and LPF2 as the blue dash line as well as the [USB 2.0] noise in green solid line. Figure D.9, \"(a) Output of LPF1 and LPF2 (b) Subtraction of LPF1 and LPF2 Output\" (b) shows the voltage difference between the two output filters, Vdiff = Vcc_afterLPF1 - Vcc_afterLPF2. The Vdiff waveform looks very similar to the Finite Difference output waveform shown in Figure D.6, \"Output of Finite Difference in dash line and Edge Detector in solid line\" so that the data recovery method through the edge detector is the same as described in Section D.1.3, \"Data Recovery\". Figure D.9 (a) Output of LPF1 and LPF2 (b) Subtraction of LPF1 and LPF2 Output D.2.3 Subtractor Output at Power Source and Power Sink The following figures shows the example when the VBUS current increases from 0A to 5A and then decreases to 0A with high load step rate. The output of the LPF1 and the Subtractor at Power Source and Power Sink are shown in Figure D.10, \"Output of the BMC LPF1 in blue dash curve and the Subtractor in red solid curve (a) at Power Source (b) at Power Sink\" (a) and (b), respectively. Although the BMC signals at Power Source and Power Sink shift toward the opposite direction, the Subtractor outputs at Power Source and Power Sink are almost identical disregard of the opposite direction of the DC offset. Figure D.10 Output of the BMC LPF1 in blue dash curve and the Subtractor in red solid curve (a) at Power Source (b) at Power Sink D.2.4 Noise Zone and Detection Zone The zone definition is the same as defined in Section D.1.4, \"Noise Zone and Detection Zone\". The sizes of the noise zone and detection zone of the Subtraction Scheme are dependent on the filter time constant. When the time constant of the first and second LPF are 200ns and 300ns, respectively, Vdetect is 250mV and Vnoise is 50mV. It is highly recommended that the product implemented with the similar techniques indicates the performance with the range of Vnoise and Vdetect in the electrical specification. E FRS System Level Example E.1 Overview Appendix E, \"FRS System Level Example\" is intended to clarify Fast Role Swap (FRS) functionality at the system level through the use of an example implementation. Figure E.1, \"Example FRS Capable System\" is an example of a Hub and laptop implementation that supports Fast Role Swap (see Figure 7.16, \"VBUS Power during Fast Role Swap\"). It is not the only possible Hub or laptop architecture. However, it is intended to provide an example system whose functionality is used here to illustrate how Fast Role Swap works. Figure E.1 Example FRS Capable System Hub Notebook Power Adapter V 1 2 HubVB H4 VB VB F F F H3 F VNbVB FRS Peripheral N4 F H6 N3 F 3 4 VB VB F F FRS H5 This appendix describes two cases that cover a variety of behaviors that might be seen in practice.  Slow VBUS Discharge where VBUS between the Hub and the laptop takes more than 15ms (tFRSwapInit) to discharge below 5.5 V (vSafe5V (max)). In this case the FR_Swap Message is sent by the laptop while VBUS is still greater than vSafe5V (max). See Figure E.2, \"Slow VBUS Discharge\".  Fast VBUS Discharge where VBUS between the Hub and the laptop discharges very quickly, perhaps be fore the Fast Role Swap Request is even complete. See Figure E.3, \"Fast VBUS Discharge\". However, neither the Hub nor the laptop can anticipate how quickly VBUS will discharge until the power adapter is disconnected from an AC Supply or it is unplugged from the Hub. The Fast Role Swap Request is the momentary low driven by the Hub on the CC wire which is detected by the laptop. Figure E.2, \"Slow VBUS Discharge\" and Figure E.3, \"Fast VBUS Discharge\" show the voltage seen on VBUS in relationship to the Fast Role Swap Request They also show the transition between when the Hub stops supplying VBUS and when the laptop starts supplying VBUS. Figure E.2 Slow VBUS Discharge VBUS voltage when it discharges slowly (assume very small cable IR drop prior to FR swap) H1 Old Source detects power loss and Old Voltage VBUS at Hub & signals Fast Role Swap Notebook New Source may turn on at any time after VBUS falls below vSafe5V(max) vSafe5V(max) VBUS at Notebook vSafe5V(min) Cable IR VBUS at drop tFRSwapTx Hub CC 0V N1 tSrcFRSwap H2 N3 N4 Current from Notebook to Hub tSnkFRSwap +3A N2 <iSnkStdby 0A In this example the Notebook is drawing little current prior to the FRS signaling. In other cases it may be drawing more current.

In other cases it may be drawing less current. E.2 FRS Initial Setup Before a Fast Role Swap can occur, some initial setup steps are required. They require the laptop to discover whether Fast Role Swap is supported by the Hub, the amount of current the Hub requires after a Fast Role Swap, and whether the laptop is able and willing to provide that amount. They also ensure that the laptop supplies VCONN before, during and after an FRS. Table E.1, \"Sequence for setup of a Fast Role Swap (Hub connected to Power Adapter first)\" and Table E.2, \"Sequence for setup of a Fast Role Swap (Hub connected to laptop before Power Adapter)\" below show two typical sequences that might be used to prepare a laptop to support Fast Role Swap.

This section describes the sequence of events that take place during a Fast Role Swap. The following figures and tables do not cover the actions of the Device Policy Manager or the Policy Engine. Those actions occur orthogonally to the electrical events shown in this appendix. However, the diagrams do indicate the inputs/outputs where the DPM and Policy Engine interact with the electrical events:  The laptop sends the FR_Swap Message to initiate the FRS AMS (see Figure 7.43, \"Transition Diagram for Fast Role Swap\") within 15ms after the laptop detects the Fast Role Swap Request on CC.  The laptop sends the final PS_RDY Message in the FRS AMS only after it is sourcing VBUS.
